This repository contains examples of a common error in Rust involving raw pointers and mutable references to vectors. The `bug.rs` file shows the error, and the `bugSolution.rs` file demonstrates a safer way to achieve the same result using proper borrowing and vector methods.  This example highlights the importance of understanding memory management in Rust when dealing with low-level operations.
